## Introduction

In the Bertram Labs, a unique tradition takes place in its team: the daily coffee run. Every day, post-lunch, Bob, Jeremy, and their five coworkers make their way to their favorite coffee shop, each with their distinct coffee preferences. From Bob's classic cappuccino to Jeremy's robust black coffee, diversity in taste is abundant. However, this ritual comes with its own challengeâ€”deciding who pays for the coffee each day, especially considering the varied costs of their preferred beverages.

Enter JavaTurn: a simple yet ingenious software solution designed to ensure fairness and ease in this daily decision-making process. By accounting for the different prices of each drink, Coffee Buddy takes on the task of determining whose turn it is to pay, ensuring everyone contributes equitably over time. Join us in exploring how Coffee Buddy brings joy and harmony to the coffee rituals of Bertram Labs, making every coffee run as smooth as the espresso it buys.
